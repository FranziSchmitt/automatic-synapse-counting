# Automation of the tedious task of counting synapses in the insect brain

Machine and deep learning (ML, DL) are powerfull tools to ease many people's daily work. However, the technology is rarely used. Yet. 

I am an alumni of the Roessler lab in the beautiful city of Würzburg (https://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/zoo2/research/roessler-lab/). During my time there, I was often amazed by some of my colleagues' endurance to spend hour after hour clicking on small bright points in a grayscale image (fig. 1): their way of counting synapses in the insect brain.

While back then I lacked the skills to help them solve this dull task in a more advanced way, after finishing training as a Data Scientist at the Data Science Retreat in Berlin, I am confident I can help them find another way.
